Project settings are accessed via the menu icon <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> in the upper left of your screen (on the [top toolbar](/overview/map-editor.html#top-toolbar)).

<span class="small plain">
![project settings](/images/project-settings.jpg)
</span>

Within the project settings, you have the following options:

* **Overview.** Add a project overview and a [license](/guides/licensing.html) for everyone to see.
* **Presentations.** Create, edit, and publish [presentations](/guides/presentations.md) to walk others through your project. Break down your complex project using the slide format of presentations, adding text, images, videos, and fully interactive map slides.
* <span data-placement="top" data-html="true" title="Available for Pro workspaces only" style="border-bottom: 1.5px dashed black"><strong>Activity feed.</strong></span> Use the activity feed to keep tabs on whoâ€™s making each change across your project.
* **Help.** Access how-to videos, the docs, [our open Slack team](chat.kumu.io), and a list of keyboard shortcuts.
* **Fields.** Manage the [fields](/guides/fields.html) for your project. Add and edit new fields, change field relevance (which fields appear in the profiles for elements, connections, and loops), and manage field appearance and behavior.
* **Members.** Give other people access to edit your map. [Learn more about collaborating in Kumu](/overview/collaboration.md).
* **Embeds.** Create a shareable link to a map, or create an iFrame to [embed your map](/guides/share-and-embed.html) on another site.
* **Trash.** View and empty the [trash](/overview/kumus-architecture.html#trash) for your project.
* **Admin.** Change privacy, rename the project, <span data-placement="top" data-html="true" title="Available for Pro workspaces only"><a href="/guides/archiving-projects.html">archive the project</a></span>, or delete the project. You can also enable/disable the image proxy when [working with images](/guides/images.html).
* **Add-ons.** Install one of Kumu's [add-ons](/guides/add-ons.html).
* **Fork project.** Create a copy of a project. [Learn more about forking](/guides/forking.html).
* **Switch project.** Navigate back to your [dashboard](/overview/dashboard.html).
* **New project.** Create a new project.


## Map settings

Map settings are accessed from the map sidebar via the ellipsis icon <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  </i> in the upper right corner of the [side panel](/overview/map-editor.html#side-panel).

<span class="small plain">
![map settings](/images/map-settings.jpg)
</span>

Each map has the following available actions:
- Rename map
- Duplicate map
- Delete map
- Make this the default map

And each map has the following settings:

* **Default view.** Select the default view for a map. This is the view that will automatically load when someone visits the map.
* **Default element behavior.** Set whether new elements should be fixed or floating. [Learn more about fixed and floating layouts](/guides/layouts.html).
* **Default connection direction.** Set whether new connections should be undirected, directed, or mutual.
  * **Undirected.** No arrows will appear at either end of the connection.
  * **Directed.** An arrow will appear at the **To** end of the connection.
  * **Mutual.** Arrows will appear at both ends of the connection.


## View settings

View settings are accessed via the Settings icon <i class="fa fa-sliders">  </i> on the right side of the map. If you want to save, rename, duplicate, or delete a view, you can click the ellipsis icon <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-h">  </i> in the upper right. You can also use that icon to set the default view for the current map.

<span class="small plain">
![view settings](/images/view-settings.png)
</span>

To learn more about editing the view itself (for example, adding decorations, filtering, changing default settings, etc.), [read the guide on View Editors](/overview/view-editors.html).

<p class="alert alert-info">
 <b>Pro tip:</b> right-click on any blank space in your map to access a quick-access toolbar that allows you to edit or delete your Project, Map or View. You can also use it to hide the direct decorations toolbar, reset your view, or access Kumu Support through here!
